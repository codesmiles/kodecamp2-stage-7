## Overview

The task was aimed at creariing a RESTful API that can perform basic CRUD processes of a user data and also calculate the distance between an active user location and a user location stored in the database.

In this task, I am going to talk about the following:

* How the app is setup and started
* Tools used to build the app
* Areas to pay attention to
* Things to note

## How the app is set up and started

* The app is set up using the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework.

* Dependencies and dev Dependencies installed using the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package manager.

* The use of MVC (Model, View, Controller) code structure is used for better code readablility

* The main file used to anchor the external app is the app.js file which can be found at the root folder

* Added information about the whole app can be found at the package.json file.

## Tools used

* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* External dependencies: [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios), [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express), [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose), [validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator), [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)
* External dev dependencies: [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)
* External APIs:[Find my address or domain location worldwide](https://rapidapi.com/ipfind/api/find-any-ip-address-or-domain-location-world-wide/)

## Areas to pay special attention to

The algorithm used to calculate the distance between two locations

```sh
 const calcDist = (x1, x2, y1, y2) => {
      let y = x2 - x1;
      let x = y2 - y1;
      const total = Math.sqrt(x * x + y * y);
      const R = 6371; //km
      const totalDistance = Math.round(total * R);
      return `The total distance between you and ${dataLog.name} is ${totalDistance}km`;
    };

```

    email
}

```

#### Response

```sh
{
    successful: true,
    message:{},
    statusCode: 200,
}
```

## NOTE

You cannot calculates the distance between your location and others if you don't already have an existing data of couple of location stored in the database
