Beginner NodeJs Learners here is your promotional task.
Problem Definition
We want to design a system that can tell us the distance between our location and some other locations which we expect to be supplied to us.
 
Task
We need to design a RESTful API that can collect the information on the different locations for us and also determine the distance between the locations and a configurable location that can be changed or supplied. The formula for calculating the distance between two points can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance.

Data Model
Define a set of data models that include
A location entity with at least the following structure, you can add more to it at your
discretion
 Id
 Location name
Description
Website (Optional)
Phone
Contact Person
Coordinates
You can make use of any database but we recommend PostgreSQL.

Rest API
The following RESTful API must be implemented
● Create a new location
● Edit Location
● Delete Location
● Fetch All Locations
● Fetch Specific Location
● Calculate distance


Deliverables
A well-documented and working codebase with RESTful API that meets all requirements stated above. The codebase should be delivered via a Github repository. The repository should contain a README with at least the following
 Details on how to set up and start the app.
Tools used.
Areas you would like us to pay special attention to.
If you could not finish, specify areas left undone and what you would have done to finish
them.
 Anything else you feel we should know about e.g. if you used a design pattern that we
should note.

Things We will Look Out For
Testing
Readability
Good Practices
Completeness (e.g. Data Validation)
Good code structure
